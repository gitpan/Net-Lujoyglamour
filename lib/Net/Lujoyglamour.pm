=head1 NAME

Net::Lujoyglamour - Create short URLs with luxury and glamour

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Net::Lujoyglamour version 0.0.4.1.9

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Lujoyglamour qw(is_valid);

    #Deploy database
    my $dsn = 'dbi:SQLite:dbname=:memory:';
    my $schema = Net::Lujoyglamour->connect($dsn);
    $schema->deploy({ add_drop_tables => 1});

    #Most straighforward way to use
    if ( is_valid( "shortie" ) {
        $schema->create_new_short( "very.long.url/like/this",
                                   "shortie" );
    }
    $schema->create_new_short( "even.longer.url/this/and/that" );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Model/Control part of a framework intended for creating short
    URLs. Inherits from L<DBIx::Class>; adds functionality for
    creating a keeping a table of long/short URLs. Funky name comes
    from the novel C< lujoyglamour.net >, in Spanish, which I also
    wrote (and obtained a literary price), and you can check out at
    L<http://lujoyglamour.es> or buy at
    L<http://compra.lujoyglamour.net>. 

The module has been tested with SQLite and MySQL, and is in fact
    running using both. You just need to change the C<$dsn> for using
    either. It hasn't been tested using other databases; would be
    grateful if anybody tried/patched for these.

=head1 INTERFACE 
    
=head2 connect( $dsn[, $username] [, $password] [, \%attr] )

Actually, inherited from L<DBIx::Class>, but useful here too

=head2 deploy

Also inherited, used for creating the database from the schema
    description in the class

=head2 is_valid( $string )

Check for requested short URL validity; only alphanumeric characters
    are allowed 

=head2 generate_candidate_url

Generates a random URL with the character limitation set. It checks
    URLs with increasing size, until it finds one.

=head2 create_new_short ( $long_url[, $short_url] )

Creates and inserts into the database a new short URL, optionally
    using a requested short URL. 

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item C<< Url space exhausted!! >> 

No more URLs availables. You probably have a very successful URL shortener site. 
You already used up all available short addresses. Time to expand your
    database!

=item C<< Invalid short URL $want_short >>

The requested URL is invalid

=back


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

You need to have a database system ready and able. If there's none
    installed, SQLite will do nicely, but do check reading/writing
    permissions over the file. Use the C<app/lg-deploy> script,
    modified for your environment, to create the initial environment. 

There are some template and CGI examples under the C<app/> directory of the
    distribution. Check them for usage, or use your own. You only need
    to keep the filenames of the C<.html> files and copy them in the
    same directory as the CGI. A C<htaccess> file is also provided as
    an example; you will have to modify it with the actual file names
    you will be using. 

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<DBIx::Class>, L<String::Random>, L<Regexp::Common> and drivers for
    database system. If you want to use the provided WebApp, you will
    need L<CGI::Application> and corresponding drivers.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Other than the limited space available, for the time being there are
    none. 

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-net-lujoyglamour@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

The module is used with a SQLite database at the site
    L<http://lugl.info/>, and with MySQL at L<http://l-g.me> (in
    Spanish). Any comments and suggestions are welcome. If you decide
    to run your URL shortener on this, please let me know.

Other URL shortening modules you might want to check out are
L<CGI::Shorten>, L<WWW::Shorten::MakeAShorterLink> and L<WWW::Shorten>, which is rather an interface for
available URL shortening services.

There is an example app at the aptly named C< app > directory,
    retrieve it from your CPAN directory or from the CPAN website.

This version includes the PDF of the novel lujoyglamour.net,
    distributed with a CC licence, in Spanish. Look under the C<t/>
    directory, and read it using your favorite PDF browser or ebook
    reader. If you publish a review, please trackback
    L<http://lujoyglamour.es> .

    scripts.
