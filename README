Net-Lujoyglamour version 0.0.4lg

If you happen to be at the same time a CPAN and a novel author, and
the novel happens to be called a CPAN-module-name-able title, it's a
slam dunk to write a module that is called more or less like the
novel. If the module can help promoting the novel, so much the
better. 

Version 0.0.4lg includes the whole novel, which has a cc-by-nc-sa
licence, in the t/ directory. Get your favorite PDF viewer to read
it. Unfortunately, it's in Spanish, but if you're interested in
translating it, feel free, what the hell, it's CC (but please tell me
just in case I need to coordinate translators)

INSTALLATION

	perl Makefile.PL
