Net-Lujoyglamour version 0.0.2

If you happen to be at the same time a CPAN and a novel author, and
the novel happens to be called a CPAN-module-name-able title, it's a
slam dunk to write a module that is called more or less like the
novel. If the module can help promoting the novel, so much the
better. 

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test

DEPENDENCIES

Those written in Makefile plus the database drivers for the one you
use.
